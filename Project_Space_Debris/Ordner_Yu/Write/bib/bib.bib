	abstract = {This article gives an overview of the active space debris removal methods that are currently in development. Orbital debris removal has become a very critical part of the commercial and scientific space management. It is an aggregating risk which needs to be immediately addressedï¿½to prevent loss of spacecraft to debris collision. The various concepts and methods which tend to bring the accumulating risk to a halt have been classified and reviewed. They are classified into collective, laser-based, ion-beam shepherd-based, tether-based, sail-based, satellite-based, unconventional, and dynamical systems-based methods. The dynamical systems-based method is a contemporary concept, which is developing at a rapid pace. Recent trends were analyzed to ascertain the evolution of the active space debris removal programs. State-of-the-art methods are essentially required to address the various sizes of space debris that need to be removed. This brings a huge opportunity in the area, which includes discovering commercially viable options, cleaning orbital regions, and optimizing crowded satellite orbits.}

	abstract = {The accumulation of space debris in low Earth orbits poses an increasing threat of collisions and damage to spacecraft. As a low-cost solution to the space debris problem the Gossamer Deorbiter proposed herein is designed as a scalable stand-alone system that can be attached to a low-to-medium mass host satellite for end-of-life disposal from low Earth orbit. It consists of a 5m by 5m square solar/drag sail that uses four bistable carbon fiber booms for deployment and support. Prior to deployment of the gossamer structure, a telescopic enclosure system is used to displace the sail from the host craft in order to extend the sail without hindrance from the host peripherals, and also provide passive stabilization. The principal advantage of an entirely passive operational mode allows the drag augmentation system to act as a ?fail-safe? device that would activate if the spacecraft suffers a catastrophic failure. Several scenarios are analyzed to study the potential application and performance of the system to current and future missions. A detailed breakdown of the mechanical subsystems of the Gossamer Deorbiter is presented, as well as the characterization process of the deployable booms and sail membrane and the full qualification testing campaign at component and system levels. Finally, the performance scalability of the concept is analyzed.}

	Space debris accumulation is on the rise as commercial space applications become more affordable and existing satellites near the end of their operational lifetimes. For geosynchronous equatorial orbits, solar radiation pressure provides a unique solution for the removal of larger debris such as inoperable satellites. Given the current state of the art in solar sailing technology, a CubeSat can be tasked to deorbit satellites on the order of 1000ï¿½kg using a high-performance solar sail for propulsion. This CubeSat, called ?TugSat,? is simulated in this study, virtually deorbiting a satellite from geostationary orbit without the use of standard propulsion systems. This same TugSat can be reused indefinitely, between the geosynchronous equatorial orbit belt and the retirement orbit, to continuously remove debris from valuable geostationary orbit slots. The entire deorbit maneuver will demonstrate control of a satellite?s semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and geosynchronous equatorial orbit belt longitude: all using techniques to optimize time rates of change in the satellite?s orbital elements. The TugSat concept provides a low-cost reusable means for geosynchronous equatorial orbit belt cleanup or open-ended geosynchronous equatorial orbit belt mission applications. }
