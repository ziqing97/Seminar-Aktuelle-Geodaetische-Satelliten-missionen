1. Sentinel 3B has completed the commissioning phse at 25 April 2018 which is the end of the 'sink' in the plots. Still, I don't know how they did it ---> check the commissioning phase operation.

3. Due to the subtle difference in altitude and inclination, the Swarm B orbit drifts slowly away from the Swarm A/C orbits at a rate of about 24°/year (difference in longitude of the ascending node). In October 2021, the orbital planes realigned, Swarm B counter-rotating with respect to Swarm A and C. To maximise the scientific return of this conjunction, the Swarm A and C satellites were brought back into the same orbital plane, starting with a manoeuvre in October 2019 that would slowly reduce the separation in longitude, achieving a perfect alignment at the exact time of the conjunction with Swarm B. During the conjunction, the distance between the Swarm A and C satellites was reduced to only 2 s along the orbit (15 km), which was previously kept between 4–10 s for safety reasons.
